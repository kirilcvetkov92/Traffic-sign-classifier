# Traffic-sign-classifier-
In this project,  deep neural networks and convolutional neural networks are used to classify traffic signs. A model is trained so it can decode traffic signs from natural images by using the German Traffic Sign Dataset. After the model is trained, the model is tested on new images of traffic signs that are find on the web
