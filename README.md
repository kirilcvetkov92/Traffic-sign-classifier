## Project: Build a Traffic Sign Recognition Program

Creating a Great Writeup
---


The Project
---
The goals / steps of this project are the following:
* Load the data set
* Explore, summarize and visualize the data set
* Design, train and test a model architecture
* Use the model to make predictions on new images
* Analyze the softmax probabilities of the new images
* Summarize the results with a written report

### Dependencies
This lab requires:
  * tensorflow-gpu==1.7.0
  * scipy==1.0.0
  * matplotlib==2.0.0
  * numpy==1.14.2
  * opencv-contrib-python==3.4.0.12
  * sklearn==0.18.2


### Dataset
